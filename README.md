2. `cd chatterm`
3. `go build --tags "fts5" .`
4. `./chatterm`

## üöÄ Supported Commands
- Ban a user: `/ban username`
- Timeout a user: `/ban username timeInSeconds`
- Search for messages: `/search something to search`
    - `from:username` restricts search to messages sent by that user
    - `channel:channelName` restricts search to messages in that channel
    - Supports wildcards and is case insensitive: `kek*` will find `KEKW`
    - Supports `AND`, `NOT`, and `OR` keywords. `/search tf2 OR ow2` will find all messages that contain at least one of those
    - This search queries the local DB, so it will only find messages that you've received while in the chat rooms
- Clear chat: `/clear` (this is the moderator clear, not a local one)
- Get a user's info: `/info username`
- Send an announcement: `/announcement something to announce`
- Give a streamer a shoutout: `/shoutout username` (untested, only works if the channel you're in is live)
- Warn a user, requiring them to acknowledge the warning before they can resume chatting: `/warn username reason`
- Delete all locally stored chat messages: `/clearall`
- Enable/disable shield mode: `/shield on|off`
- Watch a user (highlight their messages): `/watch username`
    - To remove the user, re-run the command
    - You can also manually edit the `$HOME/.config/chatterm.json` file to add/remove users under the `watched-users` key
